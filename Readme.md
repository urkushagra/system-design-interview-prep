## 🌐 Introduction

**System Design** is the process of designing the architecture, components, and data flow of a system to meet specific requirements at scale.

In interviews and real-world projects, it’s about:
- How to **handle millions of requests** efficiently  
- How to ensure **reliability and availability**  
- How to **scale systems horizontally and vertically**  
- How to **make trade-offs** between performance, cost, and complexity

## 🧩 Core Concepts

### 🔹 Basic Fundamentals
- Client-Server Architecture  
- DNS, IP, HTTP, HTTPS  
- APIs: REST, GraphQL, gRPC  
- Load Balancers  
- Caching Mechanisms (Redis, Memcached)  
- Databases: SQL vs NoSQL  
- Indexing, Replication, and Sharding  
- Horizontal vs Vertical Scaling  
- CAP Theorem  
- Latency vs Throughput
